I built a hand gesture tracking tool to draw in space and create memories with it  to simulate a daily-sketch of your life. 
# Drawing IS NOT reduced to be a graphical or even visual thing but it’s the intricate understanding of gesture of everything that’s real. 


# Documentation: 
(update 0.5 effect paper + metal ) 

Close hand = stop drawing 
Open hand = start drawing (only index supported rn) 
Functions: Clear, Save, Color desk, Size Bar, Start/Stop Drawing. 
Build in mediapipe, opencv (effects), python and pygame (hand tracking), Java, HTML/Tailwind CSS with paper.design (icons and export effect)
